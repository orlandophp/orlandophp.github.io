### Who?

We are a group of developers in the greater Orlando area that get together once a month to share ideas, hone our skills, and socialize. Diversity is our mainstay. We are fortunate to have a wide variety of members from new-comers to veterans, of all ages, cultures, and backgrounds. This allows us to have really meaningful discussions about a multitude of approaches to developing with PHP, viewing systems, and working in different environments. To learn more about our members, where we meet, and upcoming topics, checkout out our meetup page at [Orlando PHP Meetup Group @ Meetup.com](http://www.meetup.com/OrlandoPHP/).

### What?

As you will see on our Meetup.com page, there aren't just monthly meetings. Our organizer, [David Rogers](https://github.com/al-the-x), likes to keep us abreast of a number of interesting events happening all over the area.

### Where?

Mostly we meet near or around downtown Orlando at restaurants where we can share some food, some drinks and some good conversation. We will also move to more quiet environments or special venues for certain events, like talks and coding dojos. Lately, we've been meeting here :

[Lime Fresh Mexican Grill](https://www.google.com/maps/place/500+N+Orlando+Ave,+Winter+Park+Village,+Winter+Park,+FL+32789/@28.6022689,-81.3621998,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x88e7706b78df7fd3:0xa234e72113f8b3b7?hl=en) <br>

Typically we meet on the first Thursday of each month, but we also have some other events each month highlighting tech around the Orlando area. Check out our [Calendar](http://www.meetup.com/OrlandoPHP/events/calendar/?scroll=true) for a complete list of upcoming events.
