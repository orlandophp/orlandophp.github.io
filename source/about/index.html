The Orlando PHP User Group is for web development professionals looking to discuss and learn about the C-type programming language PHP, which is used in a variety of common web applications. We meet on the first Thursday of each month to present and discuss projects we're working on and trade stories from the workforce. All skill levels are welcome.
